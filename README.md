- 👋 Hi, I’m @M0NWY, AKA Simon Newhouse, AKA Newy
- 👀 I’m interested in a whole load of things as my attention / work / obsessions change.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for a BSC in computing and IT with the OU.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything you think I might be good at!
- 📫 How to reach me @simon_newhouse on twitter, simon dot newhouse at gmail dot com !
- I've just most recently done a load of messing about with scraping of sites that don't want to be scraped, and I very much enjoy the challenge. I could easily see myself gettting paid to do it.
